## What is the CCRI?

The [Canadian Century Research Infrastructure (CCRI)](http://www.ccri.uottawa.ca/CCRI/Home.html) project ran from 2003 to 2009. [Seven CCRI partner universities](http://www.ccri.uottawa.ca/CCRI/Universities.html) collaborated to produce a wealth of interrelated detailed data centred on Canada's original Census returns for 1911, 1921, 1931, 1941 and 1951. Supported by harmonized Census definitions and geographies across the censuses, this detailed microdata formed the core of the Canadian Century Research Infrastructure (CCRI).

The goal of the CCRI project was to “support research on the social, economic, demographic, cultural, political and other changes that explain what has been called 'Canada’s Great Transformation' from a sparsely populated, predominantly rural society … to a highly urbanized society“ [(CCRI Newsletter, Spring 2005)](http://www.ccri.uottawa.ca/CCRI/Images/Newsletter.Spring.2005.pdf).

Looking further at the project’s architecture, or “[Green Balloons]( http://www.ccri.uottawa.ca/CCRI/Images/The.Green.Balloons.pdf)” CCRI's Census Data is located at the centre of the infrastructure, linked with numerous Data Processing outputs, and contextual materials.

## Why another web page about CCRI's historical Census of Canada resources?

### Get to know what CCRI data is available and where to access it

This web posting introduces CCRI's ambitious range of Census data sources for Canada's decennial censuses, 1911, 1921, 1931, 1941 and 1951.  

I hope that you will, like me when writing this post, come across excellent new sources of information about the Canada's historical Censuses of Population (1911 - 1951 censuses), and be able to more readily access the historical Census information sources produced by the CCRI project.

Consult CCRI Census data and materials for in-depth information about the history of your communities or larger Canadian geographies. These data and contextual materials will provide in-depth information regarding the make-up of Canada’s peoples, the presence of cultural identities and languages, economic classes and worl, education, and family and household living during a hightly transformational time in the first half of the 20th century.

*Chaque archive de l'ICRS fournit des données et des métadonnées en français et en anglais. Ces matériels en langue française feront l'objet d'un prochaine article Web*. For those looking for French-language data and materials: the CCRI archive "web gateways" provide French, as well as English-language, CCRI resources.

## Two reasons why CCRI didn't release all of their data in "one" place

### 1&nbsp; Privacy protection

Privacy of Canadians' Census information is legally mandated for 92 years after the data is collected under section 18.1 of the [*Statistics Act*, RSC 1985, c S-19](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/s-19/fulltext.html), re: "Census: disclosure after 92 years.

To this end, only two census years are publicly accessible:[the CCRI 1911 microdata file](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/en1911census/database/index.html) and [the CCRI 1921 microdata file](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/en1921census/database/index.html). Note: the CCRI archive "web gateway" refers to these files as "databases." 

The more recent 1931, 1941 and 1951 microdata files are securely managed and housed under the Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN). See the [CRDCN application process information](https://crdcn.org/research) and a [webinar](https://crdcn.org/sites/default/files/gauvreauwebinar_21january2015.pdf) about the historical Census microdata in the CRDCN. Looking ahead, the 1931 microdata file is eligible for public release in late 2023.

### 2&nbsp; Archiving CCRI resources across partner university archives

#### 2-1&nbsp; Network of CCRI archives

CCRI archiving efforts were shared among several universities. 

Several partner universities were responsible for providing bilingual CCRI "web gateway" archives. One-point discovery and access to CCRI resources from 1911 - 1951 Censuses was not a focus for the project. Instead the focus was on the production of time-harmonized Census data (for geography and by census concepts) and supporting harmonized metadata and related documentation.  On their distributed CCRI archive "web gateways", identified CCRI partner universities and the University of Alberta archived the ambitious range of Census data and resources that were produced by the CCRI project, and ensured privacy protections.

#### 2-2&nbsp; What are the CCRI archives?

The CCRI archive "web gateways" are found at [the University of Alberta](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/enindex.html), [the University of Alberta Dataverse](https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dataverse/CCRI), [l'Université du Québec à Trois Rivières](https://cieqfmweb.uqtr.ca/fmi/webd/IRCS_CONTEXTDATA_WEB), [the University of Toronto](http://mercator.geog.utoronto.ca/ccri/index.htm) and [the University of Ottawa](http://web5.uottawa.ca/ccri//CCRI-portal-static/CCRI-portal-static-english/index.php@option=com_content&task=view&id=46&itemid=18.htm). The foregoing CCRI web archive gateways were the major sources of information for this page. However, included in the CCRI resources on this page, are those housed on alternate, and often more convenient platforms such as data repositories.

Further CCRI partner university websites are: [project host website at the University of Ottawa](http://www.ccri.uottawa.ca/), [CCRI York University Centre website](http://www.yorku.ca/ccri/index.html), [CCRI-ICRS 1911 Sample of the 1911 Canadian Census website, Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières](https://ircs1911.cieq.ca/).

Given the number CCRI archive "web gateways", ofthen with complex drill-down architectures, it is hoped that by perusing this page, you will readily differentiate the types of CCRI data resources, and hopefully zero in on the resources that meet your needs and interests.  
<br/><!-- equals 4 line breaks, 2 spaces at the end of line above -->

## Where to start?

Start with CCRI's data sources, (1) aggregate data, then, (2) microdata and (3) geographic boundary files. (Note: you will find included within these data sources, CCRI's documentation and metadata sources.) Wrap up your first CCRI search by investigating CCRI's contextual database.

## CCRI data sources

### 1 Selected published Census data tables

Consult these excel files containing tables of Census of Canada data which have been summarized (or "aggregated") by **Census divisions** and **Census subdivisions**. These aggregate data tables represent a selection made by CCRI of the official Census tables which were published in print. It is a small, interesting selection, intended to be a jumping off point for finding more Census data, especially the detailed microdata (or "databases") produced by CCRI for the years 1911, 1921, 1931, 1941 and 1951.  These Excel tables were produced from  tables were produced from the official published volumes of Canada's Censuses of Population of Canada. CCRI also produced pdf documents describing the content (or variable descriptions), as well as user guide exerpts for understanding these tables.

### 2 Microdata

A word of introduction from the [CCRI Microdata page](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/enoverview/microdata/index.html):  
*Broadly speaking, data are the raw material on which the statistics of the census are calculated. The value of microdata for research is substantial. The census offers some of the most comprehensive evidence concerning the Canadian population as a whole. In theory the modern census covers the entire country, and in practice it reports on more residents in Canada than any other source. Moreover, the Canadian census not only includes almost all the key variables that can be found in the censuses of most other countries, but also some less frequently asked questions such as those concerning religion, language, and rural/urban distinctions.*   
<!-- equals 3 line breaks, 2 spaces at the end of line above -->

| **Year** | **Total National Population** <br/> *(according to published Census volumes)* | **CCRI Sample** | **%** |
|:----:|:-----------------------------:|:-----------:|:-:|
| 1911 |           7 206 648           |   371 557   | 5 |
| 1921 |           8 788 483           |   367 475   | 4 |

### 2.1 Access CCRI microdata

- 1911 - Access [the 1911 Microdata (SPSS)](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/en1911census/database/index.html), and the companion [codebook for 1911](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/en1911census/codes/index.html)

- 1921 - Access [the 1911 Microdata (SPSS)](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/en1921census/database/index.html), and the companion [codebook for 1921](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/en1921census/codes/index.html)
 
Note, the University of Alberta "web gateway" refers to *Microdata* as **Databases**.  
 
The more recent 1931 - 1951 CCRI microdata files are *not* publicly available at present.  The reason being that their data are less than than the 92-year embargo period when Canadians' censuses must be kept private.

<br/> <!--Shannon to SUSAN: added line break -->

#### 2-2-3 Consult reference maps

Consult the reference maps below to see CCRI Census Districts, which are smaller than provinces and territories, as well as Census Subdistricts and Indian Reserves which are breakdowns of the Census Districts. These reference maps are a valuable source of information about the harmonized historical geographic areas created by CCRI, to support the selection, aggregation and and understanding of Census microdata from 1911 to 1951.

The University of Toronto was responsible for archiving all [91 reference maps](http://mercator.geog.utoronto.ca/ccri/referencemaps.htm) of Census Districts and Census Subdistricts. The reference maps are organized by Census year and by level of detail as follows. 
1. The Canada reference maps show CCRI Census District boundaries only.  Please note the accompagning list of the names of Census Districts for each census year.
2. The provincial and territorial reference maps show tbe boundaries of Census Districts, Census Subdistricts, and Indian Reserves as well, as the case may be.
3. The number of reference maps varies by level of detail. Uusally there is only one Reference Map A.  But where one reference map was insuffient to show all boundaries clearly, then a second Reference Map "B" (inset map) was produced to show enlargements of higher population areas whose boundaries not displayed clearly in Reference Map A.

##### [2-2-3-1 Reference maps for Census Districts](http://mercator.geog.utoronto.ca/ccri/referencemaps.htm)

See **Canada Reference Maps**. Reference maps by year. Notable lists of Census District codes and names (_list_of_CDs.pdf) for each year. on the University of Toronto [Distribution site for CCRI Geographic reference map files].

See **Provincial or Territorial Reference Maps**. Reference maps showing Census Districts and Census Subdistricts by Census year, and then by provinces and territories.

###### 2-2-3-3 Alternatively, do you want to use GIS?

*Reconstructed Census Geography GIS layers (boundary files) are provided for every Census year*. You can summarize CCRI data by Census districts or Census subdistricts, and using the [CCRI boundary shape files below](#3._CCRI_Census_Geography_Boundary_Files), carry out spatial analyses in GIS.

## CCRI Contextual database

From the database user guide, and from the [University of Ottawa CCRI archive](http://web5.uottawa.ca/ccri//CCRI-portal-static/CCRI-portal-static-english/index.php@option=com_content&task=view&id=306&itemid=91.htm)

### 4-1 Censuses in Context

***Documenting and Understanding the Making of Early 20th Century Canadian Census***

This database is the result of the project's approach to reflect the *organization of censuses as a complex initiative, influenced by the major political issues of the day as well as relations between the State and civil society.*  The database records *inform us on issues as fundamental as State construction, mechanisms ensuring State legitimacy, the role of cultural intermediaries, etc.*

### 4-2 Coverage of the Contextual Database

*Using varied documentation, especially the media of the period, we have been able to gather valuable information on the organization, execution, and reception of censuses across Canada from 1911 to 1951. The ContextData database comprises more than 16,000 records. Nearly 170 newspapers as well as Canadian parliamentary debates and some provincial legislative debates were systematically searched during the months preceding and following the taking of the Census.*

### 4-3 Access and Use of the Contextual database

#### 4-3-1 Access the Database and User Guide
The integrated Contextual database with a detailed user guide is found at the [Université du Québec à Trois Rivières](https://cieqfmweb.uqtr.ca/fmi/webd/IRCS_CONTEXTDATA_WEB).

#### 4-3-2 Using the Contextual Database
1. The User Guide is essential. In particular, please see the User Guide topics, **Corpus**, **Thematic Index**, and **How to use**.
