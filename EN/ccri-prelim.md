## What is the CCRI?

The [Canadian Century Research Infrastructure (CCRI)](http://www.ccri.uottawa.ca/CCRI/Home.html) project ran from 2003 to 2009. [Seven CCRI partner universities](http://www.ccri.uottawa.ca/CCRI/Universities.html) collaborated to produce a wealth of interrelated detailed data centred on Canada's original Census returns for 1911, 1921, 1931, 1941 and 1951. Supported by harmonized Census definitions and geographies across the censuses, this detailed microdata formed the core of the Canadian Century Research Infrastructure (CCRI).

The goal of the CCRI project was to “support research on the social, economic, demographic, cultural, political and other changes that explain what has been called 'Canada’s Great Transformation' from a sparsely populated, predominantly rural society … to a highly urbanized society“ [(CCRI Newsletter, Spring 2005)](http://www.ccri.uottawa.ca/CCRI/Images/Newsletter.Spring.2005.pdf).

Looking further at the project’s architecture, or “[Green Balloons]( http://www.ccri.uottawa.ca/CCRI/Images/The.Green.Balloons.pdf)” CCRI's Census Data is located at the centre of the infrastructure, linked with numerous Data Processing outputs, and contextual materials.

## Why another web page about CCRI's historical Census of Canada resources?

#### Get to know what CCRI data is available and where to find it ...

This web posting introduces the ambitious range of CCRI's Census data for Canada's decennial censuses between 1911 and 1951.

Knowing where to look for CCRI Census data and materials may be very helpful for those interested in the history of their communities, or larger geographies, as to the make-up of Canada’s peoples, presence of cultural identities and languages, economic classes and education to family and household living during this transformational period.

It should be highlighted that CCRI data and related materials are also available in French. All CCRI archives provide both English and French-language data and metadata. *Chaque archive de l'ICRS fournit des données et des métadonnées en français et en anglais. Ces matériels en langue française feront l'objet d'un prochaine article Web.*

### Reasons why CCRI didn't release their Census data and materials in "one" place

#### Privacy protection

Privacy of Canadians' Census information is mandatory for 92 years after the data is collected, as per [section 18.1 of the *Statistics Act* re: "Census -- disclosure after 92 years"](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/s-19/fulltext.html).

As a result, only the CCRI [1911 microdata file](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/en1911census/database/index.html) and the [1921 microdata file](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/en1921census/database/index.html) were made publicly available. The website refers to the microdata as "databases." Whereas, restrictions to the 1931, 1941 and 1951 microdata files are managed by the Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN). See the [CRDCN application process information](https://crdcn.org/research) and a [webinar](https://crdcn.org/sites/default/files/gauvreauwebinar_21january2015.pdf) about the historical Census microdata in the CRDCN. Looking ahead, the 1931 microdata file is eligible for public release in late 2023.

#### Archiving of CCRI resources across partner university archives

###### A network of archives

CCRI archiving efforts were shared between several universities with the collaboration of Statistics Canada for the 1931 - 1951 censuses. Several partner universities were responsible for their own bilingual CCRI archive web sites. One one-point access to CCRI resources was not a focus for the project. Archiving, rather than a single portal, was the focus because of the scope of the archiving: first, the multiplicity of the CCRI resources (including harmonized concepts and geographies, sophisticated CCRI documentation, supporting CCRI data); and second, privacy protections.

###### Source archives

At a high level, the information on this page can be found on the following CCRI web sites: the [University of Alberta](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/enindex.html) (and the University of Alberta [Dataverse](https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dataverse/CCRI), [l'Université du Québec à Trois Rivières](https://cieqfmweb.uqtr.ca/fmi/webd/IRCS_CONTEXTDATA_WEB), the [University of Toronto](http://mercator.geog.utoronto.ca/ccri/index.htm) and [University of Ottawa](http://www.ccri.uottawa.ca/CCRI/Home.html). In addition to these archive sites, the [project web site](http://www.ccri.uottawa.ca/) was hosted at University of Ottawa. 

Considering there are several CCRI partner web sites, much can be gained from perusing this page for an overview of the range of resources available from these websites and other platforms.

## Where to start?

Start with CCRI's data sources, (1) Selected Published Census Data Tables, (2) CCRI microdata, and (3) CCRI geographic boundary files. Relevant Census documentation and metadata materials are included with links to the data. Conclude by considering CCRI's contextual database.

As happened to me when compiling this information, I hope that some of this information may help you in your awareness of CCRI's Census of Canada data, or in your use of this important source of historical Census data.

## CCRI data sources

### 1. Selected published Census data tables

Consult these excel files containing historical Census of Canada data summarized (or "aggregated") by Census divisions and Census subdivisions. These aggregate data tables are a selection of original print Census tables by the CCRI project intended serve as a jumping off point for the more detailed microdata for Canada's 1911 - 1951 censuses.  CCRI produced these Excel summary tables from the published volumes of Census of Population of Canada tables and also produced user guide extracts for these tables.  

The Excel table names found below follow the naming convention, `CCRI_PUB_YYYY_V#T#.xls`, while the variable name look-ups (descriptions) follow the naming convention, `YYYY_V#T#_Variable.pdf`.

### 2. Microdata

A word of introduction (from the [CCRI Microdata page](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/enoverview/microdata/index.html)):

> Broadly speaking, data are the raw material on which the statistics of the census are calculated. The value of microdata for research is substantial. The census offers some of the most comprehensive evidence concerning the Canadian population as a whole. In theory the modern census covers the entire country, and in practice it reports on more residents in Canada than any other source. Moreover, the Canadian census not only includes almost all the key variables that can be found in the censuses of most other countries, but also some less frequently asked questions such as those concerning religion, language, and rural/urban distinctions.

### 2.1 Access CCRI microdata

1911  
- [Microdata* (SPSS)](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/en1911census/database/index.html)     
- [_codebook for 1911_](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/en1911census/codes/index.html)  

1921    
- [Microdata* (SPSS)](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/en1921census/database/index.html)  
- [_codebook for 1921_](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/en1921census/codes/index.html)  
*The website refers to microdata as "Databases". The above data files are public, allowable because these censuses are older than the 92-year period when Canadians' censuses must be kept private.

### 2.2 Access data documentation

The following microdata documentation applies to all Census years.

#### 2.2.1 Compare CCRI census variables

* See list of core Census variables: [CCRI variables that are identical in each of the five censuses](http://web5.uottawa.ca/ccri//CCRI-portal-static/CCRI-portal-static-english/read-and-edit/ccri-read-and-edit-core-variables-table.pdf)   
* Codebook
  * Browse topics: [High-level CCRI Census variable groupings](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/endatabase/variables/index.html),
  * Drill down by variables: navigate to **The Database** (upper menu) and select **Variables** ,
  * Find your variable codebook: select your variable grouping, and variables of interest.  (The "Derived" grouping covers several topics.)
  * The codebook for your variable(s) of interest provides detailed informaton including, the years where the variable appears, and further details (drilling down by year, e.g., answer coding).
* Codebook ([option 2](http://web5.uottawa.ca/ccri/CCRI-portal-static/CCRI-portal-static-english/index.php@option=com_content&task=section&id=6&itemid=279.htm), bilingual)
* [See also list of non-core CCRI Census variables](http://web5.uottawa.ca/ccri//CCRI-portal-static/CCRI-portal-static-english/read-and-edit/ccri-read-and-edit-non-core-variables-table.pdf)

#### 2.2.2 Official Census of Population of Canada documentation
* [Schedules](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/enresources/schedules/index.html) (official Census schedules, or Census "questions")  
* [Enumerator instructions](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/enresources/enumeratorinstructions/index.html) (official enumerator instructions).
* [Census Guides](http://web5.uottawa.ca/ccri//CCRI-portal-static/CCRI-portal-static-english/index.php@option=com_content&task=view&id=4&itemid=100.htm) (CCRI documentation)  
  * Select Year / Census schedule of interest  
  * Scroll down to **Census Schedule Questions**  
  * Select your Census question of interest  
  * A Census question guide displays. The guide comprises sections A to I, covering details for each question, including who was asked each question, how was it asked, enumerator instructions and variable (click on variable for how the question was recorded).

#### 2.2.3 Consult maps

CCRI created harmonized geography for the selection and aggregation of Census microdata. Census Districts are smaller than provinces and territories, and Census Subdistricts and Indian Reserves are in turn breakdowns of Census Districts.

The University of Toronto was responsible for archiving [91 reference maps](http://mercator.geog.utoronto.ca/ccri/referencemaps.htm) of CCRI's geographies. The maps are organized by Census year and level of detail. Level of detail: the provincial and territorial reference maps show both Census Districts and Census Subdistricts (and where relevant, Indian Reserves), while the Canada reference maps only show Census Districts. Number of reference maps: where one reference map is insuffient to clearly show all geographies, then a Reference Map B (inset map) is provided with enlargements of areas not shown adequately in Reference Map A.

##### [Reference maps for Census Districts](http://mercator.geog.utoronto.ca/ccri/referencemaps.htm)

See **Canada Reference Maps**. Reference maps by year. Notable lists of Census District codes and names (_list_of_CDs.pdf) for each year. on the University of Toronto [Distribution site for CCRI Geographic reference map files].  

###### [Reference maps for Census Subdistricts](http://mercator.geog.utoronto.ca/ccri/referencemaps.htm)

See **Provincial or Territorial Reference Maps**. Reference maps showing Census Districts and Census Subdistricts by Census year, and then by provinces and territories.

##### Alternatively, do you want to use GIS?

*Reconstructed Census Geography GIS layers (boundary files) are provided for every Census year*. You can summarize CCRI data by Census districts or Census subdistricts, and using the [CCRI boundary shape files below](#3._CCRI_Census_Geography_Boundary_Files), carry out spatial analyses in GIS.

## CCRI Contextual database

From the database user guide, and from the [University of Ottawa CCRI archive](http://web5.uottawa.ca/ccri//CCRI-portal-static/CCRI-portal-static-english/index.php@option=com_content&task=view&id=306&itemid=91.htm)

### 1. Censuses in Context

***Documenting and Understanding the Making of Early 20th Century Canadian Census***

This database is the result of the project's approach to reflect the *organization of censuses as a complex initiative, influenced by the major political issues of the day as well as relations between the State and civil society.*  The database records *inform us on issues as fundamental as State construction, mechanisms ensuring State legitimacy, the role of cultural intermediaries, etc.*

### 2. Coverage of the Contextual Database

*Using varied documentation, especially the media of the period, we have been able to gather valuable information on the organization, execution, and reception of censuses across Canada from 1911 to 1951. The ContextData database comprises more than 16,000 records. Nearly 170 newspapers as well as Canadian parliamentary debates and some provincial legislative debates were systematically searched during the months preceding and following the taking of the Census.*

### 3. Access and Use of the Contextual database

#### 3.1 Access the Database and User Guide
The integrated Contextual database with a detailed user guide is found at the [Université du Québec à Trois Rivières](https://cieqfmweb.uqtr.ca/fmi/webd/IRCS_CONTEXTDATA_WEB).

#### 3.2 Using the Contextual Database
The User Guide is essential. In particular, please see the User Guide topics, **Corpus**, **Thematic Index**, and **How to use**.
