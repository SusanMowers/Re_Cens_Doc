## What is the CCRI?

The [Canadian Century Research Infrastructure (CCRI)](http://www.ccri.uottawa.ca/CCRI/Home.html) project ran from 2003 to 2009. [Seven CCRI partner universities](http://www.ccri.uottawa.ca/CCRI/Universities.html) collaborated to produce a wealth of interrelated detailed data centred on Canada's original Census returns for 1911, 1921, 1931, 1941 and 1951. Supported by harmonized Census definitions and geographies across the censuses, this detailed microdata formed the core of the Canadian Century Research Infrastructure (CCRI).

The goal of the CCRI project was to “support research on the social, economic, demographic, cultural, political and other changes that explain what has been called 'Canada’s Great Transformation' from a sparsely populated, predominantly rural society … to a highly urbanized society“ [(CCRI Newsletter, Spring 2005)](http://www.ccri.uottawa.ca/CCRI/Images/Newsletter.Spring.2005.pdf).

Looking further at the project’s architecture, or “[Green Balloons]( http://www.ccri.uottawa.ca/CCRI/Images/The.Green.Balloons.pdf)” CCRI's Census Data is located at the centre of the infrastructure, linked with numerous Data Processing outputs, and contextual materials.  


## Why another web page about CCRI's historical Census of Canada resources?

### Get to know what CCRI data is available and where to find it ...

This web posting introduces the ambitious range of CCRI's Census data for Canada's decennial censuses between 1911 and 1951.

Knowing where to look for CCRI Census data and materials may be very helpful for those interested in the history of their communities, or larger geographies, as to the make-up of Canada’s peoples, presence of cultural identities and languages, economic classes and education to family and household living during this transformational period.

It should be highlighted that CCRI data and related materials are also available in French. All CCRI archives provide both English and French-language data and metadata. *Chaque archive de l'ICRS fournit des données et des métadonnées en français et en anglais. Ces matériels en langue française feront l'objet d'un prochaine article Web.*
<br/><!-- Susan TO SELF & SHANNON: Does this equal 2 line breaks -->
## Two reasons why CCRI didn't release their Census data and materials "all in one place"

### Privacy protection

Privacy of Canadians' Census information is mandatory for 92 years after the data is collected, as per [section 18.1 of the *Statistics Act* re: "Census: disclosure after 92 years"](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/s-19/fulltext.html).

As a result, only the CCRI [1911 microdata file](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/en1911census/database/index.html) and the [1921 microdata file](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/en1921census/database/index.html) were made publicly available. The website refers to the microdata as "databases." Whereas, restrictions to the 1931, 1941 and 1951 microdata files are managed by the Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN). See the [CRDCN application process information](https://crdcn.org/research) and a [webinar](https://crdcn.org/sites/default/files/gauvreauwebinar_21january2015.pdf) about the historical Census microdata in the CRDCN. Looking ahead, the 1931 microdata file is eligible for public release in late 2023.
<br/>

### Archiving of CCRI resources across partner university archives

#### - A network of archives

CCRI archiving efforts were shared among several universities with the collaboration of Statistics Canada for the 1931 - 1951 censuses. Several partner universities were responsible for their own bilingual CCRI archive web sites. One one-point access to CCRI resources was not a focus for the project. Archiving, rather than a single portal, was the focus because of the scope of the archiving: first, the multiplicity of the CCRI resources (including harmonized concepts and geographies, sophisticated CCRI documentation, supporting CCRI data); and second, privacy protections.

#### - What are the source archives?

The CCRI archive gateways are: the [University of Alberta](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/enindex.html) (and the University of Alberta [Dataverse](https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dataverse/CCRI), [l'Université du Québec à Trois Rivières](https://cieqfmweb.uqtr.ca/fmi/webd/IRCS_CONTEXTDATA_WEB), the [University of Toronto](http://mercator.geog.utoronto.ca/ccri/index.htm) and [University of Ottawa](http://web5.uottawa.ca/ccri//CCRI-portal-static/CCRI-portal-static-english/index.php@option=com_content&task=view&id=46&itemid=18.htm). The foregoing CCRI web archive gateways were the major sources of information for this page. 

In addition, the other important to CCRI partner university websites are, the [host project web site at the University of Ottawa](http://www.ccri.uottawa.ca/), the [CCRI York University Centre] website(http://www.yorku.ca/ccri/index.html).

Considering these various CCRI partner web sites above and their sometimes complicated architecture, perusing this page first is recommended for an overview of the range of available CCRI data resources from not just these websites, but other data repositories and platforms as well.

## Where to start?

Start with CCRI's data sources: (1) aggregate data, (2) microdata, and (3) geographic boundary files. Included in this section is relevant location information for documentation and metadata, as wel as links to publicly avaiable data. And then conclude by investigating (4) investigating CCRI's contextual database.

I hope, as happened with me, when compiling this page, that you will become more aware of some historical Census of Population of Canada data which you may not have known about before, and that you will be able to more readily find and use key sources of information from the 1911 - 1951 decennial Canadian censuses.

## CCRI data sources

### 1. Selected published Census data tables

Consult these excel files containing tables of Census of Canada data which have been summarized (or "aggregated") by **Census divisions** and **Census subdivisions**. These aggregate data tables represent a selection made by CCRI of the official Census tables which were published in print. It is a small, interesting selection, intended to be a jumping off point for finding more Census data, especially the detailed microdata (or "databases") produced by CCRI for the years 1911, 1921, 1931, 1941 and 1951.  These Excel tables were produced from  tables were produced from the official published volumes of Canada's Censuses of Population of Canada. CCRI also produced pdf documents describing the content (or variable descriptions), as well as user guide exerpts for understanding these tables.

### 2. Microdata

A word of introduction (from the [CCRI Microdata page](https://ccri.library.ualberta.ca/enoverview/microdata/index.html)):

> Broadly speaking, data are the raw material on which the statistics of the census are calculated. The value of microdata for research is substantial. The census offers some of the most comprehensive evidence concerning the Canadian population as a whole. In theory the modern census covers the entire country, and in practice it reports on more residents in Canada than any other source. Moreover, the Canadian census not only includes almost all the key variables that can be found in the censuses of most other countries, but also some less frequently asked questions such as those concerning religion, language, and rural/urban distinctions.
<br/>

| **Year** | **Total National Population** <br/> *(according to published Census volumes)* | **CCRI Sample** | **%** |
|:----:|:-----------------------------:|:-----------:|:-:|
| 1911 |           7 206 648           |   371 557   | 5 |
| 1921 |           8 788 483           |   367 475   | 4 |

#### 2.2.3 Consult reference maps

Consult the reference maps below to see CCRI Census Districts, which are smaller than provinces and territories, as well as Census Subdistricts and Indian Reserves which are breakdowns of the Census Districts. These reference maps are a valuable source of information about the harmonized historical geographic areas created by CCRI, to support the selection, aggregation and and understanding of Census microdata from 1911 to 1951.

The University of Toronto was responsible for archiving all [91 reference maps](http://mercator.geog.utoronto.ca/ccri/referencemaps.htm) of Census Districts and Census Subdistricts. The reference maps are organized by Census year and by level of detail as follows. 
1. The Canada reference maps show CCRI Census District boundaries only.  Please note the accompagning list of the names of Census Districts for each census year.
2. The provincial and territorial reference maps show tbe boundaries of Census Districts, Census Subdistricts, and Indian Reserves as well, as the case may be.
3. The number of reference maps varies by level of detail. Uusally there is only one Reference Map A.  But where one reference map was insuffient to show all boundaries clearly, then a second Reference Map "B" (inset map) was produced to show enlargements of higher population areas whose boundaries not displayed clearly in Reference Map A.

##### [2.2.3.1 Reference maps for Census Districts](http://mercator.geog.utoronto.ca/ccri/referencemaps.htm)

See **Canada Reference Maps**. Reference maps by year. Notable lists of Census District codes and names (_list_of_CDs.pdf) for each year. on the University of Toronto [Distribution site for CCRI Geographic reference map files].

###### [2.2.3.2 Reference maps for Census Subdistricts](http://mercator.geog.utoronto.ca/ccri/referencemaps.htm)

See **Provincial or Territorial Reference Maps**. Reference maps showing Census Districts and Census Subdistricts by Census year, and then by provinces and territories.

###### 2.2.3.3 Alternatively, do you want to use GIS?

*Reconstructed Census Geography GIS layers (boundary files) are provided for every Census year*. You can summarize CCRI data by Census districts or Census subdistricts, and using the [CCRI boundary shape files below](#3._CCRI_Census_Geography_Boundary_Files), carry out spatial analyses in GIS.

<br> <!-- Shannon to SUSAN: added the single line breaks between the 2.2.1/2/3/4 sections, almost seems like too much space though. Thoughts? -->

#### 2.2.4 Methodology documentation

* [Data Dictionary](http://web5.uottawa.ca/ccri//CCRI-portal-static/CCRI-portal-static-english/index.php@option=com_content&task=view&id=310&itemid=95.htm).

## CCRI Contextual database

From the database user guide, and from the [University of Ottawa CCRI archive](http://web5.uottawa.ca/ccri//CCRI-portal-static/CCRI-portal-static-english/index.php@option=com_content&task=view&id=306&itemid=91.htm)

### 4.1 Censuses in Context

***Documenting and Understanding the Making of Early 20th Century Canadian Census***

This database is the result of the project's approach to reflect the *organization of censuses as a complex initiative, influenced by the major political issues of the day as well as relations between the State and civil society.*  The database records *inform us on issues as fundamental as State construction, mechanisms ensuring State legitimacy, the role of cultural intermediaries, etc.*

### 4.2 Coverage of the Contextual Database

*Using varied documentation, especially the media of the period, we have been able to gather valuable information on the organization, execution, and reception of censuses across Canada from 1911 to 1951. The ContextData database comprises more than 16,000 records. Nearly 170 newspapers as well as Canadian parliamentary debates and some provincial legislative debates were systematically searched during the months preceding and following the taking of the Census.*

### 4.3 Access and Use of the Contextual database

#### 3.1 Access the Database and User Guide
The integrated Contextual database with a detailed user guide is found at the [Université du Québec à Trois Rivières](https://cieqfmweb.uqtr.ca/fmi/webd/IRCS_CONTEXTDATA_WEB).

#### 3.2 Using the Contextual Database
The User Guide is essential. In particular, please see the User Guide topics, **Corpus**, **Thematic Index**, and **How to use**.
